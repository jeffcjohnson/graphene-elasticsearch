Integrate Graphene and Elasticsearch with DocumentObjectType and DocumentConnectionField

NOTE: This is from a project I was working on in 2017 that was put on hold.
I would be happy to contribute this code to another project or add maintainers to this project.

IMPORTANT: This is just the raw code right now.
If there is interest I could use https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage[cookiecutter-pypackage] to make it an installable package.

This package roughly mirrors how graphene_django works but for ElasticSearch Documents instead of Django Models.

It provides DocTypes that are similar to Django Models.

So far I have DocumentObjectType and DocumentConnectionField.
